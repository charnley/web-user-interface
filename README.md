Web User-interface
==================

A small CSS (and JS) frame for easy web-application interfaces.

Basically the idea is, you as a scientist don't want to spend time learning CSS,
you just want to make a website with the right functionality. Well, download the code
and just focus and writing the backend. See demo.html for HTML syntax.

Let me know if there are any elements missing.
